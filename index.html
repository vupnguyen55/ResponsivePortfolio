                     What I would like to learn in this class looks to me like what everyone else would also like to accomplish in this semester to come, relevancy. I understand that, to an extent, coding is an ever-developing skill. What was so sought out to be learned a decade ago might not hold as much importance in today’s software labor force. I would still love to learn and even expand my current knowledge about the most popular languages like Java, Javascript, Swift, Python, C++, and Ruby; however, I think that these languages will become outdated and will eventually be replaced one day. Even with this progressive mentality, I do think that it is important to learn these languages as sort of a base or a foundation to expand upon for future knowledge and reference.

                     As far as personal interests are concerned, I am very interested in seeing what new or more modern languages are being utilized in the field and/or what is recommended by the professors to stay up-to-date. Keeping that in mind, there are subjects that I am really excited to learn like mySQL and jQuery. My goal in this course is to become a qualified full stack developer that is well-versed in languages – old and new. I understand that the course is rigorous and will be packed with an abundance of various topics that would be a feat to cram into just three months.

                     Undoubtedly, this semester will be a huge step in the right direction towards becoming an efficient and effective software developer. The course that Georgia Tech’s team has developed looks to be very engaging, which is important, because interested students will become innovative workers. At the time of writing this, I am anxious and excited to start class. Reflecting on my past and thinking about my future, I am fortunate to have found the means of living that I both enjoy and am interested in continuously improving my proficiency on. I am sure that these coming months will help me develop the knowledge and skills that I already possess into something that resembles what I need to hold to create a future for myself.
